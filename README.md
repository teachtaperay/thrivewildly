# Thrive Wildly LLC Website

This repository hosts the static website for Thrive Wildly LLC, a floral design company. The primary purpose of this website is to provide a low-maintenance, SEO-friendly online presence that acts as a thin wrapper around existing point-of-sale (POS) and order form endpoints.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the core structure and styling.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and custom UI development, ensuring a professional and responsive design without the need for extensive JavaScript.
*   **Jotform/Square:** Embedded or linked for handling subscriptions, bloom bar bookings, and standard/custom order forms.

## Purpose

The website serves to:

1.  **Enhance SEO:** Provide a dedicated domain and content for search engine optimization, allowing Thrive Wildly LLC to rank higher for relevant searches.
2.  **Centralize Access:** Offer a single, branded entry point for customers to access various services (subscriptions, bookings, orders) hosted on external platforms.
3.  **Maintain Low Overhead:** Utilize a static site approach with minimal JavaScript to ensure easy maintenance and deployment.
